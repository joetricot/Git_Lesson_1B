# Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

## "A New Hope"
### Act I

* In `~/desktop`, create a new directory called `GitPractice`.

* In your `~/desktop/GitPractice` directory, create a new directory called `star_wars`.

> Example answer: `mkdir star_wars`

* In the `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.

> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`.

> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.
> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a directory called `death_star`.
> paste your command here

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`.
> paste your command here

### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory.
> paste your command here

* Create a file called `princess_leia`

> paste your command here

* Create a file called `obi_wan`.
> paste your command here

* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`.
> paste your command here

* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`.
> paste your command here

* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`.
> paste your command here

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi_wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`.

### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory.

> paste your command here

* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory.
